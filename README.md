# Uncle Welly's Smart Tuckshop System #  


*Project Summary*
Every time I visit my Uncle Welly, he asks me to check his stock levels and analyze his sales â€” but I only do this maybe once a year. To solve this and help run his small tuckshop efficiently, I built this project to:
* Track stock available
* Log and summarize daily sales
* Notify when stock drops below 10
* Store receipts for past days
* Let my uncle view sales and profits easily

This project uses a simple system where stock is updated, sales are tracked, and receipts are generated automatically. It's lightweight and ideal for small local shops in Zimbabwe or similar regions.

*Features*
.Stock Management: Add product photos, initial stock, and prices
. Sales Tracking: Every item sold updates the database in real-time
. Low Stock Alerts: Notification sent when items are less than 10
. Profit Calculation: Tracks and logs profit from sales
. Receipt Generator: Each checkout produces a printable digital receipt
. Android App (Owner's Side): View available stock and sales reports from anywhere
. Dashboard (Power BI): Visual reports of profit, top sellers, and trends
